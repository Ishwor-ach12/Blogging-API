# 📝 React Blog Interface

This project is a **practice React application** that demonstrates a simple interface for maintaining small blog posts.  
It is designed using **React.js**, with styling for a clean and minimal UI.  
Although the stack mention includes **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, this particular project only contains the **frontend implementation** with no backend integration.

---

## 📌 Abstract

The **React Blog Interface** allows users to explore the fundamental concepts of React development, such as:  
- Component-based architecture  
- State and props management  
- Handling forms and controlled components  
- Rendering dynamic lists  

It is a **frontend-only** project that mimics the structure of a blog application, created solely for learning and practicing React development concepts.
